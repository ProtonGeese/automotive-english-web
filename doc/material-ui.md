# Material-UI

## Motivation

Rather than try to develop a UI from raw HTML5 elements which would be ugly and
barely functional we decided to use an existing UI framework built on React.

## Choice

We went with Material UI because it could be customized to fit just about any
branding, it had a series of high quality components and icons, and the 'android'
paradigm is familiar and intuitive to a lot of users.
